# midi_to_audio
Convert MIDI to wav audio file using soundfonts

Instructions:
MIDI and Soundfont files are here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1WKTwZJB4HURXCjyasPGF4BfFstsLrTou?usp=sharing

Both folders should be in the root directory for the jupyter notebook code to run. 
For SoundFonts, currently the cello.sf2 and guitar_bass2.sf2 files do not work.
